World Insight Dashboard
This is a customizable web dashboard displaying a curated collection of global data sources, live maps, and informational tools in a clean grid layout. It embeds several embeddable websites directly via iframes, such as Liveuamap, Nextstrain, Sentinel EO Browser, Window Swap, and others, while providing direct links for sites that do not allow embedding (e.g., EarthCam, NOAA Space Weather Center).

The dashboard serves as a one-stop interface for exploring real-time world phenomena like news, satellite imagery, space weather, global statistics, and interesting live cams â€” all accessible from a single page.

The design features a marble white background, responsive grid layout, and clear labeling for easy navigation. The file can be opened locally in any modern web browser or hosted online for sharing.
